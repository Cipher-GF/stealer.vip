# Atomic Stealer's Offical Website (Source)

### Why Release This?
Flashbyte and Clash are just really sus when it comes to communication and when it's time for payment, they want me to accept ITC as payment even though I told them that I accept ETH ONLY.<br>
<br>My plan back then was to get my payment in ETH and buy a OG username minecraft account, but I was later told I would be given a MFA with ranks on servers like hypixel, even good stats would be provided with the account. Now, I'm not paid and also now being ghosted by them. If they went on vacation and they do come online and pay me then forget the source code of the website or extras that came with the purchase never became public.<br> <br> The whole project is dead imo (In My Opinion) and might as well show you all how much effort I put in making this website...
  
 <br>
  
  <h3>Fun Fact:</h3> This website is not made by me completly and most of it comes from https://nighty.one (They told me to do it)<br><br>
  
  <br>
  
  I'm Hireable btw ;)
