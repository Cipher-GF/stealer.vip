# Atomic Stealer's Offical Website (Source)

### Why Release This?
Flashbyte and Clash are just really sus when it comes to communication and when it's time for payment, they want me to accept ITC as payment (I Don't want to accept ITC and I want ETH).<br>
<br>My plan back then was to get my payment in ETH and buy a OG username minecraft account, but I was later told I would be given a MFA with very nice ranks like MVP++ on servers like hypixel, even good stats would be given with the account. <img src="https://github.com/atomic-stealer/Assets/raw/main/Atomic_Logo.png?raw=true" width="300" height="300"> Now, I'm not paid with the right crypto and now being ghosted by them. The whole project is dead imo (In My Opinion) and might as well show you all how much effort i put making this website...
  
 <br>
  
  I would also want tell you all that this website is not made by me completly and most of it comes from https://nighty.one
